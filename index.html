            <h3>Selective Dog Breeding</h3>
            <p>
                Selective dog breeding is the process in which we 
                breed the dogs to selectively develop a particular
                trait. To develop the beloved Pomsky, breeders
                resorted to crosbreeding, which is the mix of two
                purebreds.

            <h3>Characteristics and Traits</h3>
            <p>
                Since the breed is still very new, it's hard to 
                predict the exact characteristics and traits the
                puppy will have. Some of the possible characteristics
                are to be small-medium in size, weight from 20-30
                pounds, a beautiful silky coat, medium-length coat
                that is usually composed of two colors. Eye color can
                range from brown to blue, some even having different
                colored eyes. The Pomsky, being a dog on the smaller
                scale, is fit to be an apartment dog, though it requires
                moderate to high activity. Behaviourwise, we can expect the
                Pomsky to possess mixed traits of the Husky and
                Pomeranian.

            <h3>Health of A Pomsky</h3>
            <p>
                There is not much information on their health
                due to being a new breed, but some of the health
                concerns are a mix of both Husky and Pomeranian
                health issues. Some of the health issues that
                are a major concern for a Pomsky are:

            <p>
                Pomskies can be stubborn and strong willed,

                humans and dogs. Here we will list 5 essential things
                a Pomsky owner must teach their pup:
                <ol>

                    <li>Biting Prevention</li>
